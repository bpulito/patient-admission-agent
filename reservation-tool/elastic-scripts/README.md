# Elasticsearch Scripts
This directory holds a number of scripts that can be used to interact with Elasticsearch. 

## Setup
Be sure to setup the .env file in the root reservation-tool directory. After the .env is setup you will need to create the Elasticsearch index by running the **es-create-index.sh** script.
